# Everything as code
The "everything as code" approach revolutionizes IT management by treating infrastructure and configurations like software itself. This code-driven approach unlocks many benefits: reduced human error through automation and version control, increased consistency across environments, and boosted scalability through reusable templates. 

## What is typically under the everything as code umbrella?
- Feature code
- Infrastrcutre
- Configuration
- Documentation

## What are the benefits of everything as code?
- Reduced human error: Automation through code minimizes the risk of errors caused by manual configuration. Pull requests can act as an additional quality gate to ensure high standards are kept.
- Increased consistency: Having a main branch ensures consistent configurations across different environments, improving reliability and predictability. Codifying standards also improves the quality of the deliverable.
- Improved agility: Changes can be implemented quickly and easily through code, enabling faster deployments.
- Enhanced collaboration: Repositories can be shared and version-controlled, facilitating collaboration among teams.
- Simplified auditing and compliance: Storing things in repositories provides a clear audit trail of  changes, simplifying compliance with security and regulatory requirements.
